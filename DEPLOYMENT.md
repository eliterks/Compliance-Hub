# Delhi Flow Guide - Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare the Project
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test the build locally
npm run build

# Preview the built site
npm run preview
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Drag & Drop Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` to create the `dist` folder
2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag the `dist` folder to the deployment area
4. Your site will be live instantly!

#### Option B: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Connect the repository to Netlify
3. Use these build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18`

#### Option C: CLI Deployment
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Initialize and deploy
netlify init
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
If you need to add environment variables:
1. Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables in Netlify
2. Add any required variables (currently none are needed)

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to Site Settings > Domain Management
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS as instructed by Netlify

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `netlify.toml`
- Configures build settings
- Sets up redirects for React Router
- Optimizes assets and security headers

### `public/_redirects`
- Ensures all routes redirect to index.html for SPA routing

### `vite.config.ts`
- Configured for optimal production builds
- Includes code splitting for better performance

## 🎯 Performance Features
- **Code Splitting**: Vendor and router code are split into separate chunks
- **Minification**: CSS and JS are automatically minified
- **Caching**: Static assets have long-term caching headers
- **Security**: Security headers are configured in netlify.toml

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Ensure all merge conflicts are resolved
- Run `npm run build` locally to test
- Check that all dependencies are installed

### Routing Issues
- Verify `_redirects` file exists in `public/` folder
- Ensure netlify.toml has the redirect configuration

### Slow Loading
- Check if code splitting is working (should see multiple JS files in dist/)
- Verify Netlify's CDN is serving assets

## 📊 Build Output
A successful build should show:
```
dist/index.html           1.64 kB │ gzip:  0.58 kB
dist/assets/index-*.css  76.55 kB │ gzip: 12.84 kB
dist/assets/router-*.js  18.06 kB │ gzip:  6.83 kB
dist/assets/vendor-*.js 141.28 kB │ gzip: 45.44 kB
dist/assets/index-*.js  344.86 kB │ gzip: 92.34 kB
```

## 🌐 Live Site Features
Once deployed, your site will have:
- ✅ Fast loading with optimized assets
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ SEO-friendly meta tags
- ✅ Secure HTTPS
- ✅ Global CDN delivery
- ✅ Automatic deployments (if using Git)
